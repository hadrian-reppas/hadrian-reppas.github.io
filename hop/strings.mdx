# Strings

Here is some sample code that demonstrates the standard library's
Unicode-capable `String` struct:

```hop
import std::string::{push free new_string putln pointer}

global EXPECTED: *byte { "abcങ𢄯Γx𢐎yz" }

fn main {
    new_string
    @ 'a' push
    @ 'b' push
    @ 'c' push
    @ 'ങ' push
    @ '𢄯' push
    @ 'Γ' push
    @ 'x' push
    @ '𢐎' push
    @ 'y' push
    @ 'z' push
    @ putln                         // print the string
    @ pointer EXPECTED streq assert // check that it's equal to the expected string
    free
}
```
