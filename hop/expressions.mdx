# Expressions

Writing everything in [reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
is kind of a pain. When doing complicated math, you can use expressions.
Expressions are surrounded by parenthesis. Inside expressions, all the normal
precedence rules apply and functions can be called like C functions. Our
`quad_form` function now looks like this:

```hop
fn sqrt float -> float { 0.5 pow }

fn quad_form let a: float b: float c: float -> float {
    ((-b + sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*a))
}
```

The compiler basically parses the expression, checks that every function called
returns a single value and then flattens the expression. So

```hop
    (3*f(1, 3 + 2))
```

becomes

```hop
    3 1 3 2 + f *
```

Inside expressions, you can return to normal Hop syntax with square brackets.
This is usually not that useful.

```hop
    (3*f(1, [3 2 +]))
```
