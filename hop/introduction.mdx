# Introduction

Hop is a statically typed, compiled programming language. Like [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)),
Hop is stack-based. Instead of assigning values to variables, values are pushed
and popped from an implicit stack. When called, functions pop their arguments off 
the stack and push their return values back onto it. Let's look at an example.

## Hello World

Here is a hello world program in Hop:


```hop
// hello_world.hop

fn main {
    "Hello, World!" putlns
}
```

When this program is run, the string literal `"Hello, World!"` is pushed onto the
stack. The `putlns` function then pops the string from the stack and prints it.

## Running Hop Code

The Hop compiler is called `chop`. `chop` transpiles Hop code to C code. It is
invoked like this:

```shell
$ chop hello_world.hop
```

`chop` produces a file called `out.c`. The C file can be compiled by any C compiler
and run.

```shell
$ clang -o out out.c
$ ./out
Hello, World!
```
